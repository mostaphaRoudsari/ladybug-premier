* ##### energyCostPerKWh [Optional]
The cost of one kilowatt hour in any currency unit (dollar, euro, yuan...) - If not supplied, 0.15 $/kWh will be used as default value. - In currency/kWh.
* ##### collectorEmbodiedEnergyPerM2 [Optional]
Energy necessary for product life-cycle of SWH collector per square meter. - If not supplied default value of 1135 (MJ/m2) for unglazed or glazed flat plate collector will be used. - In MJ/m2 (megajoules per square meter).
* ##### tankEmbodiedEnergyPerL [Optional]
Energy necessary for product life-cycle of storage tank per liter. - If not supplied default value of 20 (MJ/l) will be used. - In MJ/l (megajoules per liter).
* ##### collectorEmbodiedCO2PerM2 [Optional]
Carbon emissions produced during SWH collector's life-cycle per square meter.. - If not supplied default value of 65.5 (kg CO2/m2) for unglazed or glazed flat plate collector will be used. - In kg CO2/m2 (kilogram of CO2 per square meter).
* ##### tankEmbodiedCO2PerL [Optional]

* ##### collectorLifetime [Optional]
Life expectancy of a SWH collector. - If not supplied default value of 15 (years) will be used. - In years.
* ##### tankLifetime [Optional]
Life expectancy of a storage tank. - If not supplied default value of 10 (years) will be used. - In years.
* ##### optimal [Optional]
Set to "True" to calculate optimal system size and tank storage volume. - Larger system sizes and tank volumes produce more energy, therefor cover more initial heating load, which results in less usage of auxiliary energy. However, the larger the system size and tank volume, more embodied energy is spent. In order to find an optimal system size (total size of all collectors) and storage tank volume, life-cycle energy analysis is used to acheive the maximal net energy saving of the swh system. The net energy saving of swh system is the energy saving in kWh remained after an annualized embodied energy (of collectors or storage tank) has been deducted from the operating energy saving of swh system. This method of optimization is superior in comparison with other simulation-based methods due to consideration of all energy performance stages (production, operation, maintenance...). - This optimization method can be used to account for capital costs, instead of embodied energy. This would account only for operation performance stage. In this case capital costs of collector/per square meter, and tank/per liter would need to be inputted into: "collectorEmbodiedEnergyPerM2_" and "tankEmbodiedEnergyPerL_" inputs. - Optimization analysis based on the law of diminishing marginal utility: "A simplified method for optimal design of solar water heating systems based on life-cycle energy analysis", Renewable Energy journal, Yan, Wang, Ma, Shi, Vol 74, Feb 2015 www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148114004807
