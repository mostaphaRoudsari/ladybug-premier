![](../../images/components/Sunpath_Shading.png)

This component calculates the shading of: - Photovoltaic modules - Solar Water Heating collectors - any other purpose (shading of points) - Use "annualShading", "Sep21toMar21Shading" and "Mar21toSep21Shading" outputs for Photovoltaic modules shading.  Use "beamIndexPerHour" and "skyExposureFactor" outputs for Solar Water Heating collectors shading, or any other purpose. Use "shadedSolarRadiationPerHour" data for "solarRadiationPerHour_" input of "Thermal Comfort Indices" component to account for shading. - "annualShading" output is based on "Using sun path charts to estimate the effects of shading on PV arrays", University of Oregon, Frank Vignola: http://solardat.uoregon.edu/download/Papers/UsingSunPathChartstoEstimatetheEffectofShadingonPVArrays.pdf - 

#### Inputs
* ##### epwFile [Required]
Input .epw file path by using the "File Path" parameter, or Ladybug's "Open EPW And STAT Weather Files" component.
* ##### analysisGeometry [Required]
Input surface(a) or point(b) (a single one or more of them). - a) Input planar Surface (not polysurface) on which the PV modules/Solar water heating collectors will be applied. If you have a polysurface, explode it (using "Deconstruct Brep" component) and then feed its Faces(F) output to _analysisGeometry. Surface normal should be faced towards the sun. - b) You can also supply point(s) and its shading will be calculated. - Geometry inputted to "_analysisGeometry", will be accounted for self-shading, so there is no need to input it to the "context_" also.
* ##### context [Optional]
Buildings, structures, mountains and other permanent obstructions. - If you supplied surface(s) to the "_analysisGeometry", input them into the "context_" too, to account for self-shading. If you inputted point(s) into the "_analysisGeometry", there's no need to input them into the "context_". - Input polysurfaces, surfaces, or meshes.
* ##### coniferousTrees [Optional]
This input allows for partial shading from coniferous(evergreen) context trees. - Input polysurfaces, surfaces, or meshes.
* ##### deciduousTrees [Optional]

Deciduous context trees transmission index for in-leaf period. In-leaf being a period from 21st March to 21st September in the northern hemisphere, and from 21st September to 21st March in the southern hemisphere. It ranges from 0 to 1.0. 0 represents deciduous trees which do not allow solar radiation to pass through them (100% shading). 1 represents all solar radiation passing through deciduous trees, like the trees do not exist (0% shading). - If not supplied default value of 0.23 (equals 77% shading) will be used. - Unitless.
* ##### deciduousLeaflessIndex [Optional]
Deciduous context trees transmission index for leaf-less period. Leaf-less being a period from 21st September to 21st March in the northern hemisphere, and from 21st March to 21st September in the in the southern hemisphere. It ranges from 0 to 1.0. 0 represents deciduous trees which do not allow solar radiation to pass through them (100% shading). 1 represents all solar radiation passing through deciduous trees, like the trees do not exist (0% shading). - If not supplied default value of 0.64 (equals 36% shading) will be used. - Unitless.
* ##### leaflessPeriod [Optional]
Define the leafless period for deciduous trees using Ladybug's "Analysis Period" component. IMPORTANT! This input affects only the skyExposureFactor, beamIndexPerHour, shadedSolarRadiationPerHour output. Due to limitations of the used sunpath diagram, it does not affect the Sep21toMar21Shading, Mar21toSep21Shading, annualShading outputs, where default leafless periods (see the line bellow) will always be used. - If not supplied the following default periods will be used: from 21st September to 21st March in the northern hemisphere, and from 21st March to 21st September in the in the southern hemisphere.
* ##### ACenergyPerHour [Optional]
This input is necessaty only if you are calculating the shading of the PV modules. If that is so, input the "ACenergyPerHour" output data from "Photovoltaics surface" component. - If you are calculating shading analysis for "Solar water heating surface" component (instead of "Photovoltaics surface" component), leave this input empty. - If you are calculating shading analysis for any other purpose (of point(s) for example) leave this input empty too.
* ##### north [Optional]
Input a vector to be used as a true North direction, or a number between 0 and 360 that represents the clockwise degrees off from the Y-axis. - If not supplied, default North direction will be set to the Y-axis (0 degrees).
* ##### albedo [Optional]
A list of 8767 (with header) or 8760 (without the header) albedo values for each hour during a year. Albedo (or Reflection coefficient) is an average ratio of the global incident solar radiation reflected from the area surrounding the _analysisGeometry. It ranges from 0 to 1. - It depends on the time of the year/day, surface type, temperature, vegetation, presence of water, ice and snow etc. - If no list supplied, default value of 0.20 will be used, corrected(increased) for the presence of snow (if any). - Unitless.
* ##### outputGeometryIndex [Optional]
An index of the surface inputted into "_analysisGeometry" if "_analysisGeometry" would be flattened.. It determines the surface for which output geometry will be generated. - If not supplied, geometry for the first surface (index: 0) will be generated as a default.
* ##### scale [Optional]
Scale of the overall geometry (sunPath curves, sunWindow mesh). Use the scale number which enables encompassing all of your context_, coniferousTrees_, deciduousTrees_ objects. - If not supplied, default value of 1 will be used.
* ##### hoursPositionScale [Optional]
Scale factor for positioning of solar time hour points (that's "hoursPositions" output). - If not supplied, default value of 1 will be used.
* ##### precision [Optional]
Overall shading precision. Ranges from 1-100. It represents the square root number of shading analysis points per sun window quadrant. Example - precision of 20 would be 400 shading analysis points per single sun window quadrant. CAUTION!!! Higher precision numbers (50 >) require stronger performance PCs. If your "_context" contains only straight shape buildings/objects, and you have just a couple of trees supplied to the "coniferousTrees_" and "deciduousTrees_" inputs, the precision of <= 50 will be just fine. - If not supplied, default value of 20 will be used.
* ##### legendPar [Optional]
Optional legend parameters from the Ladybug "Legend Parameters" component.
* ##### bakeIt [Optional]
Set to "True" to bake the Sunpath shading results into the Rhino scene. - Baking can only be used if surface(s) is(are) inputted into _analysisGeometry and data is inputted in ACenergyPerHour_. Otherwise there will be nothing to be baked. - If not supplied default value "False" will be used.
* ##### runIt [Required]
...

#### Outputs
* ##### readMe!
...
* ##### skyExposureFactor
Continuous Sky Exposure Factor - portion of the visible sky (dome). It defines the shading of the diffuse irradiance components. It ranges from 0 to 1. 0 means that the sky dome is competely obstructed by obstacles and all incoming diffuse sky irradiance is blocked (100% shading). 1 means that sky dome is competely free of obstacles (0% shading). - This output is similar to "skyView" output of Ladybug's "Shading Mask" component. Unlike "skyView" it takes into account transparency of trees. But it does not visually present the shading, which is what "Shading Mask" component does. - Use it for Ladybug "Solar Water Heating System" or "Solar Water Heating System Detailed" component's "skyExposureFactor_" input to account for diffuse irradiance shading of SWHsurface. - Unitless.
* ##### beamIndexPerHour
