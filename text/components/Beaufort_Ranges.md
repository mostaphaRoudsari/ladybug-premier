This component outputs conditional statements as per beaufort scale that you can plug in conditionaStatement_ input of wind rose component. These conditionals statements basically represent a range of wind velocity. For example, “Calm” relates to winds with velocities in the range of 0 m/s to 0.2 m/s. On plugging this component to wind rose, a summary would be added to the text displayed at the bottom of this wind rose. For those interested in learning more about Beaufort scale, following is a good resource https://github.com/devngc/References/tree/master/Beaufort%20Scale https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale
